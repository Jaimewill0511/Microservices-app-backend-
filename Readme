Frontend Development
HTML: Create the structure and layout of your web pages using HTML elements.
JavaScript: Implement interactive features and dynamic content using JavaScript.
Backend Development
Python: Write the server-side logic using Python.
Database Connectivity: Establish a connection to your chosen database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and perform CRUD operations.
Dockerization
Dockerfile: Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend components, specifying the base images, dependencies, and build instructions.
Build Images: Build the Docker images using the docker build command.
Kubernetes Deployment
Deployment: Define the desired state of your application using a Deployment manifest.
Service: Expose your application as a service within the Kubernetes cluster.
Ingress: Configure external access to your application using an Ingress resource.
GitHub Version Control
Create Repository: Create a new GitHub repository to store your project code.
Commit and Push: Commit your changes regularly and push them to the remote repository.
Branching and Merging: Use Git branches for feature development and to manage different versions of your code.
